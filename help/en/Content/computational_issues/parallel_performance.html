        <h1>Parallel performance</h1>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> is capable of running on a multiprocessor system, parallelizing a
single DDA simulation. It uses MPI for communication routines. This feature can
be used both to accelerate the computations and to circumvent the
single-computer limit of the available memory, thus enabling simulations with a
huge number of dipoles. We do not discuss the parallel efficiency of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> in detail, since it largely depends on the hardware. However, in
our experience it was usually larger than 70–90% on a modern computer clusters
(if the FFT grid is optimally partitioned among the processors, §</span><span>6.6</span><span>), and
close to 100% in sparse mode (§</span><span>12.3</span><span>). It
is also important to note that the MPI interface may occupy significant amount
of RAM on each node, thereby decreasing the RAM available for </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> itself (see also §</span><span>5</span><span> and §</span><span>6.6</span><span>).</span></p>
