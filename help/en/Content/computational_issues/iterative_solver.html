        <h1>Iterative solver</h1>

<p><span>The main computation of a DDA simulation,
usually taking the major part the execution time, is finding a solution of a large
system of linear equations. </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> uses an alternative form of Eq. </span><span>(<span>20</span>)</span><span>:</span></p>

<p><span>Decomposition of is possible if and
only if it is complex-symmetric. This is sufficient for the current version of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>, which supports only diagonal polarizability tensors. Since , the interaction matrix <b>A</b>
is complex–symmetric and Jacobi-preconditioned (has unity diagonal). </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> incorporates several different iterative methods for solution of
Eq. </span><span>(68)</span><span>: Bi-conjugate
gradient (Bi-CG) </span><span>[70,71]</span><span>,
Bi-CG stabilized (Bi-CGStab) </span><span>[72]</span><span>,
enhanced Bi-CGStab(2) </span><span>[73]</span><span>, conjugate
gradient applied to normalized equations with minimization of the residual norm
(CGNR) </span><span>[72]</span><span>, CSYM </span><span>[74]</span><span>, quasi minimal residual (QMR) </span><span>[70]</span><span> and its modification based on 2-term recurrence
(QMR<sub>2</sub>) </span><span>[75]</span><span>. Adding
of a new iterative solver is straightforward for anyone who is familiar with C
programming language.<a><span><span><span><span>[66]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Comparison of the iterative solvers in terms
of matrix–vector products (MVPs) per iteration and required number of vectors
(memory, see §</span><span>5</span><span>) is
presented in </span><span>Table <span>3</span></span><span>. Some
solvers employ the complex symmetric property of <b>A</b> to calculate only one
MVP per iteration </span><span>[70]</span><span>.
Our experience suggests that QMR is usually the fastest iterative solver,
however in some cases Bi-CGStab may be faster (also their modern variants,
namely QMR<sub>2</sub> and Bi-CGStab(2) respectively, may be preferred – see
below). Performance of Bi-CG is comparable to that of QMR, but convergence behavior
of the former is erratic, similar to that of Bi-CGStab. Still, Bi-CG may be
preferred when memory is sparse. While being the slowest, CGNR is very simple
and its convergence is guaranteed to be monotonic </span><span>[72]</span><span>.
CSYM has the same properties, and is expected to be faster than CGNR, in terms
of MVPs </span><span>[74]</span><span>. QMR<sub>2</sub>
is expected to be faster than QMR in finite-precision arithmetic </span><span>[75]</span><span> and
requires slightly less memory. Bi-CGStab(2) is expected to be faster than
Bi-CGStab </span><span>[73]</span><span> in
terms of MVPs, but requires slightly more memory.</span></p>

<p><span>The iterative solver is chosen by the command
line option </span></p>

<p><span>-iter &lt;type&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span>&lt;type&gt;</span><span> is one of the values specified in </span><span>Table <span>3</span></span><span>. By
default QMR is used. There are several options to choose the initial field, set
by the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-init_field {auto|inc|read
&lt;filenameY&gt; [&lt;filenameX&gt;]|wkb|zero}</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span><span>zero</span></span><span> vector is a general
approach and </span><span><span>inc</span></span><span> (derived from the incident field, more precisely – equal to the
right-hand-side of the linear system) may be closer to the exact solution for
small index-matching particles. </span><span><span>wkb</span></span><span> is derived from the incident
field corrected for phase shift during propagation in the particle (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin
approximation </span><span>[76]</span><span>). It can be considered as an extension of </span><span><span>inc</span></span><span>, but currently it works only for default incident beam – plane wave
propagating along the <i>z</i>&#8209;axis in particle reference frame (§</span><span>9</span><span>) and
not in the surface mode (§</span><span>7</span><span>).<a><span><span><span><span>[67]</span></span></span></span></a>
By default (</span><span><span>auto)</span></span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> automatically choses from </span><span><span>zero</span></span><span> and </span><span><span>inc</span></span><span> the one with lesser residual norm.<a><span><span><span><span>[68]</span></span></span></span></a>
Finally, the starting field can also be </span><span><span>read</span></span><span> from files. Normally two
files are required for <i>y</i>&#8209; and <i>x</i>&#8209;polarizations
respectively (§</span><span>9.1</span><span>), but
a single filename is sufficient if only<i> y</i>&#8209;polarization is used
(e.g. due to symmetry). Incident field should be specified in a <i>particle</i>
reference frame, see §</span><span>B.7</span><span> for
file format. The choice of initial field is shown in the </span><span>log</span><span> (§</span><span>C.4</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>It is important to note, that initial field </span><span><span>inc</span></span><span> corresponds to , i.e. it sets exciting field, while both </span><span><span>wkb</span></span><span> and </span><span><span>read</span></span><span> define internal field <b>E</b><sub>(0)</sub>,
cf. Eq. </span><span>(68)</span><span>. In
particular, “</span><span><span>&#8209;beam
read fY fX –init_field inc</span></span><span>” is not completely
equivalent to “</span><span><span>&#8209;init_field
read fY fX</span></span><span>” in terms of the starting vector. The
connection between the two fields depends on the polarizability formulation (§</span><span>10.1</span><span>), but
can be approximately described as (this equation is
exact for CM polarizability).</span></p>

<p><span>The stopping criterion for iterative solvers
is the relative norm of the residual. The process stops when this norm is less
than <i>&#949;</i>, which can be specified
by the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-eps &lt;arg&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>where <i>&#949;</i> = 10<sup>&#8722;&lt;arg&gt;</sup>.
By default, <i>&#949;</i> = 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>.
It is important to note that the residual is updated iteratively along the
execution of the iterative solver, which may cause substantial round-off errors
for large number of iterations. True residual at the end of the iterative
solver can be calculated by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> through additional MVP. For that specify</span></p>

<p><span>-recalc_resid</span></p>

<p><span>in the command line. The maximum number of
iterations can be specified as </span><span>&lt;arg&gt;</span><span> to the command
line option</span></p>

<p><span>-maxiter &lt;arg&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>If this number is reached before
convergence (to <i>&#949;</i> level) </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> will produce a warning, but will continue to calculate the
(potentially less accurate) scattering quantities. So </span><span><span>–maxiter</span></span><span> can be used to softly limit the simulation time. By default the maximum
number of iterations is set to a very high value, which is not expected to be ever
reached.<a><span><span><span><span>[69]</span></span></span></span></a>
Also, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> will terminate execution with an error if the iterative solver
stagnates for a long time, i.e. residual norm do not decrease during a number
of last iterations. Corresponding numbers are specified in </span><span>Table <span>3</span></span><span>.<a><span><span><span><span>[70]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p><span>All iterative
solvers except CGNR and CSYM are susceptible to breakdowns. Although such
situations are very improbable, they may happen in specific cases. For
instance, simulation of light scattering by cube with edge length that is
exactly a multiple of the wavelength results in breakdowns of QMR, QMR<sub>2</sub>,
and Bi-CG. </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> should detect almost any breakdown and produce a meaningful error
message; however, it is possible that some breakdown is not detected. It then
results in the stagnation of the residual norm or its oscillations without any
further progress. On contrary, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> may claim breakdown when
the convergence is slow but still satisfactory. The behavior of breakdown
detection may be modified,<a><span><span><span><span>[71]</span></span></span></span></a>
but it requires recompilation of the code.</span></p>

<p><span>If you notice
any error of the breakdown detection, both false-negative and false-positive,
please communicate it to the developers. If the breakdown does appear, the
solution is either to try different iterative solver or adjust input parameters
a little bit. Usually changing particle size (or wavelength) by only 0.01%
completely eliminates the breakdown.</span></p>

<p><span>In general, it
is hard to estimate the required number of iterations <i>a priori</i>. However, for the case of particles much smaller than the
wavelength (e.g., nanoparticles) in free space a simple formula is available </span><span>[47]</span><span>:</span></p>

<p><span>which depends on neither particle shape nor
size (as long as the latter is sufficiently small) and is expected to be
accurate within a factor of two for QMR and Bi-CG.</span></p>
