        <h1>Checkpoints</h1>

<p><span>To facilitate very long simulations </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> incorporates a checkpoint system, which can be used to break a
single simulation into smaller parts. All the intermediate vectors of the
iterative solver (§</span><span>12.1</span><span>) are
saved, which allows restarting the iterative solver exactly at the position,
where the checkpoint was created. Time of a checkpoint is specified by command
line option</span></p>

<p><span>-chpoint &lt;time&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span>&lt;time&gt;</span><span> is in format “</span><span>#d#h#m#s</span><span>”.<a><span><span><span><span>[82]</span></span></span></span></a>
There are 3 possible strategies for checkpoints, chosen through the command
line option</span></p>

<p><a><span>-chp_type
&lt;type&gt;</span></a></p>

<p><span><span>where
</span></span><span><span>&lt;type&gt;</span><span> is one of </span></span><span><span>normal</span><span>, </span></span><span><span>regular</span><span>, </span></span><span><span>always</span><span>. “Normal” means that after the checkpoint time elapsed, the
checkpoint is saved as soon as possible (it waits for the finishing of the
current iteration) and </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> finishes execution without any further actions. This type is useful
when one need </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> to run not longer than certain time. “Regular” checkpoints are
saved after every specified time interval but do not influence the normal
execution of </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> – it runs until simulation is fully completed. Use this option when
abrupt termination of </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> may occur (e.g. system crash or the system resources are urgently
needed for other tasks). “Always” type is similar to “normal” if checkpoint
time elapsed during the execution, however it will also save a checkpoint (after
the last iteration) when </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> finishes normally earlier. That is the only checkpoint type, for
which time may be not specified (then it is equivalent to infinite time). It
may be useful if the simulation is valuable by itself but may be extended in
the future, e.g. to obtain better convergence (lower <i>&#949;</i>, §</span></span><span><span>12.1</span></span><span><span>) or to calculate different
scattering quantities (§</span></span><span><span>11</span></span><span><span>).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>To
restart the simulation from a checkpoint</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>-chp_load</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>should
be specified in the command line. The user should take care that the simulation
is restarted with the same parameters that were used when saving the
checkpoint. Although some parameters can indeed be different (e.g. those
determining the output of </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>), the consistency of the results is user’s responsibility. By
default all the checkpoint data is saved in the directory </span></span><span><span>chpoint</span><span> (§</span></span><span><span>D.2</span></span><span><span>), however a different
directory (the same for saving and loading of checkpoints) can be specified through
the command line option</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>-chp_dir
&lt;dirname&gt;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The
total size of the checkpoint files is approximately half of the RAM used,
therefore 1) enough space on the hard disk should be available; 2) saving of a
checkpoint may take considerable time. Both issues are especially relevant for
large simulations on multiprocessor systems. If the simulation time is strictly
limited (e.g. by a batch system of a supercomputer with shared usage)
checkpoint time should be set slightly smaller, so that </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> would have enough time to finish the iteration and save a
checkpoint (and possibly to calculate the scattering quantities if the iterative
solver will converge just before the checkpoint time). User should estimate the
needed time reserve himself. When loading a checkpoint, </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> initializes anew, this takes some time. However, this time is
usually small compared to the time used for the iterations.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>It is
also important to note that by default the same checkpoint directory is used
for all the simulations on the current system that are run from the same path,
therefore new checkpoints overwrite the old ones.</span></span><a><span><span><span><span><span><span>[83]</span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span> To avoid it specify a
different checkpoint directory for each instance of </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>; it is obligatory when several instances of </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> run in parallel. For now, </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> <i>always</i> saves checkpoints
into the same directory where it loads it from.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Currently
only the state of the iterative solver is saved at a checkpoint, therefore it
is suitable only for simulations for a single incident polarization.</span></span></p>
