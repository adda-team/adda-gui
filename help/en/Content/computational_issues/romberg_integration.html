        <h1>Romberg integration</h1>

<p><span>Integration is performed in several parts
of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>: orientation averaging (§</span><span>8.2</span><span>),
integration of the Mueller matrix over the azimuthal angle (§</span><span>11.2</span><span>), and
integration of the scattered field over the whole solid angle (§</span><span>11.4</span><span>). The
same routine is used for all these purposes, which is based on the one- or
two-dimensional Romberg integration </span><span>[82]</span><span>.
This is a high-order technique that may be used in adaptive mode, automatically
performing only the necessary number of function evaluations to reach a prescribed
accuracy. The latter is relevant for orientation averaging, where each function
evaluation is a complete DDA simulation, but not for integration over
scattering angles, for which all values are precalculated. Romberg integration
also provides an estimate of the integration error, which is reliable for
“sufficiently nice” functions </span><span>[82]</span><span>.
When 2D integration is performed </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> integrates an error
estimate obtained in the inner integration loop simultaneously with the
function values, resulting in a reliable estimate of the final error in the
outer loop. The information about the integration together with errors is saved
to separate log files (§</span><span>C.10</span><span>): </span><span>log_orient_avg</span><span>, </span><span>log_int_Csca&#8209;X</span><span>, </span><span>log_int_asym_x&#8209;X</span><span>, </span><span>log_int_asym_y&#8209;X</span><span>, </span><span>log_int_asym_z&#8209;X</span><span> for orientation averaging, calculation of <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> and each component of <b>g</b> respectively (the last 4 file names have different suffixes – </span><span>X</span><span> or </span><span>Y</span><span> – for different incident
polarizations). For orientation averaging some information is saved to the main
</span><span>log</span><span> (§</span><span>C.4</span><span>). For
integration of the Mueller matrix over the azimuthal angle only the averaged
errors are saved together with the values directly to </span><span>mueller_integr</span><span> files (§</span><span>C.5</span><span>)</span></p>

<p><span>The drawback of the Romberg integration is
that argument values must be uniformly spaced and their total number is limited
to be 2<i><sup>n</sup></i> + 1 (<i>n</i> is any integer). The set of
integration points is specified by minimum and maximum values and minimum and maximum
number of subdivisions (refinements) <i>J</i><sub>min</sub>
and <i>J</i><sub>max</sub> (the latter is equal
to <i>n</i>). The required accuracy to reach
is also a parameter. In some cases minimum and maximum values of some arguments
are equivalent (e.g. 0° and 360° for <i>&#966;</i>),
</span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> accounts for it to slightly decrease simulation time.</span></p>

<p><span>If the function is “nice” and periodic over
the interval of integration, then it is not beneficial and may be even harmful
to use higher order integration scheme. For such cases the simplest trapezoid
rule (or equivalently midpoint rule) is the most efficient </span><span>[82]</span><span>.
The same is true, when e.g. the function is integrated over the half of its
period and is symmetric with respect to both borders of the integration
interval. </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>’s behavior is determined by the flag </span><span>periodic</span><span> in the input files. If it is </span><span>true</span><span>
then trapezoid rule is used as a special case of the general Romberg scheme.
This keeps the limitation on the number of integration points, but provides
adaptability and reliable error estimates. All the integration parameters are
specified in input files: </span><span>avg_params.dat</span><span> (§</span><span>B.2</span><span>),</span><span> scat_params.dat</span><span> (§</span><span>B.4</span><span>), </span><span>alldir_params.dat</span><span> (§</span><span>B.3</span><span>)
corresponding to different integration tasks.</span></p>
