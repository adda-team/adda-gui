        <h1>Sommerfeld integrals</h1>

<p><span>The four Sommerfeld integrals used by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> to calculate reflection term (ยง</span><span>10.3</span><span>) are
expressed through two essential integrals <i>V</i><sub>22</sub>
and <i>U</i><sub>22</sub> </span><span>[52,83]</span><span>:</span></p>

integration of either Bessel or Hankel functions with appropriate deformation
of complex path:</span></p>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> calculates Sommerfeld integrals using slightly modified routine
from NEC2C,<a><span><span><span><span>[84]</span></span></span></span></a>
which is a Fortran-to-C translation of </span><span>[52]</span><span>. This
routine contains internal error control, and has been tested to produce
consistent (within 0.1%) results in comparison with other codes </span><span>[84,85]</span><span>. Still,
it should be regarded as a black box. While the accuracy is expected to be
sufficient for most applications, it is hard to confidently put any numbers on
it.</span></p>

<p><span>To accelerate computations </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> first computes a table of Sommerfeld integrals for all unique
values of <i>&#961;</i> and <i>Z</i> required for dipoles on the computational
grid, which takes time comparable to 200 iterations of the iterative solver<a><span><span><span><span>[85]</span></span></span></span></a>.
Moreover, such table requires additional memory (ยง</span><span>5</span><span>).</span></p>
