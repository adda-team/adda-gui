        <h1>Using the Manual</h1>

<p><span>This manual is intended to cover the
computational and physical aspects of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>, i.e. choosing proper
values for input parameters, performing the simulations, and analyzing the
results. In particular, the succeeding sections contain instructions for:</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>running a sample simulation (§</span><span>3</span><span>);</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>defining a scatterer (§</span><span>6</span><span>) and
its orientation (§</span><span>8</span><span>);</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>specifying the type and
propagation direction of the incident beam (§</span><span>9</span><span>);</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>specifying the DDA formulation
(§</span><span>10</span><span>);</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>specifying what scattering
quantities should be calculated (§</span><span>11</span><span>);</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>understanding the computational
aspects (§</span><span>12</span><span>) and
timing of the code (§</span><span>13</span><span>);</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>understanding the command line
options (§</span><span>A</span><span>) and
formats of input (§</span><span>B</span><span>) and
output (§</span><span>C</span><span>)
files.</span></p>

<p><span>A lot of technical aspects are covered by
online wiki pages, which are extensively referred to throughout the manual. This
manual assumes that you have already obtained the executable for </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>. You can either download the full source code and compile it
yourself,<a><span><span><span><span><span>[12]</span></span></span></span></span></a> or download precompiled executables
for Windows.<a><span><span><span><span><span>[13]</span></span></span></span></span></a> Both source and executable packages
of the recent release can be downloaded from <a>https://github.com/adda-team/adda/releases</a>.
</span></p>

<p><span>If you want to
use the latest features or track the development progress, you may download the
recent source directly from the </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> repository using web
browser<a><span><span><span><span><span>[14]</span></span></span></span></span></a> or any git client.<a><span><span><span><span>[15]</span></span></span></span></a>
Please mind, however, that the latest between-releases version may be unstable.
If you decide to try it and discover any problems, comment on this in the issue
tracker.</span><sup><span>5</span></sup></p>

<p><span>Everywhere in this manual, as well as in input
and output files, it is assumed that all angles are in degrees (unless explicitly
stated differently). The unit of length is assumed µm; however, it is clear
that it can be any other unit, if all dimensional values are scaled
accordingly. However, scaling of units of radiation forces is more subtle (§</span><span>11.6</span><span>).</span></p>
