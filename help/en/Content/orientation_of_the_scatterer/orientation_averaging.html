<p><span>Orientation averaging is performed over
three Euler angles (<i>&#945;</i>,<i>&#946;</i>,<i>&#947;</i>). Rotating over <i>&#945;</i>
is equivalent to rotating the scattering plane without changing the orientation
of the scatterer relative to the incident radiation. Therefore, averaging over
this orientation angle is done with a single computation of internal fields;
additional computational time for each scattering plane is comparably small.
Averaging over other two Euler angles is done by independent DDA simulations
(defining the orientation of the scatterer as described in §</span><span>8.1</span><span>). The
averaging itself is performed using the Romberg integration (§</span><span>12.6</span><span>),
parameters of the averaging are stored by default in file </span><span>avg_params.dat</span><span> (§</span><span>B.2</span><span>).
Orientation averaging is enabled by the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-orient avg [&lt;filename&gt;]</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span>&lt;filename&gt;</span><span> is an optional argument that specifies a different file with
parameters of the averaging. Integration points for <i>&#946;</i> are spaced uniformly in values of cos<i>&#946;</i> </span><span>[39]</span><span>. Currently
only the Mueller matrix in one scattering plane (§</span><span>11.2</span><span>), <i>C</i><sub>ext</sub>, and <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub> (§</span><span>11.4</span><span>) are
calculated when doing orientation averaging.</span></p>

<p><span>It also cannot be used in combination with
saving incident beam (§</span><span>9</span><span>), internal
fields or dipole polarizations (§</span><span>11.7</span><span>), or
radiation forces (§</span><span>8.2</span><span>), nor
with calculating scattering for a grid of angles (§</span><span>11.2</span><span>).</span></p>
