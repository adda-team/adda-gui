        <h1>Reflection term</h1>

<p><span>In contrast to <b>G&#773;</b> the reflection term <b>R&#773;</b>
does not have full translational symmetry, but only the one parallel to the
surface. In particular, <b>R&#773;</b> is a
function of distance between evaluation point and the image of source:</span></p>

  <p><span>(</span><span><span>39</span></span><span>)</span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>where <b>&#961;</b>
is the distance along the surface. Also, it satisfies . The simplest option to calculate the reflection term is
based on a single image dipole</span></p>

  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>where is a projector on the <i>z</i>&#8209;axis, and . This approach is exact for perfectly conducting substrate
(ยง</span><span>7</span><span>), and
can be considered a fast approximation otherwise. The accuracy of the
approximation improves with increasing <i>Z</i>
and/or |<i>&#949;</i><sub>s</sub>|.</span></p>

<p><span>The general rigorous approach to calculate <b>R&#773;</b> is based on Sommerfeld
integrals </span><span>[52]</span></p>

 <tr>

  <p><span>,</span></p>
  </td>

  <p><span>(</span><span><span>41</span></span><span>)</span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>where the scaling (factor
of <i>k</i><sup>2</sup>) is the same as that
used for <b>G&#773;</b> in Eq. </span><span>(<span>33</span>)</span><span>, and
the integrals , , , and depend on <i>&#961;</i>, <i>Z</i>, and <i>&#949;</i><sub>s</sub>.
Particular expressions for these integrals and computational aspects are
discussed in ยง</span><span>12.7</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>The choice of the reflection term is performed
by the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-int_surf {img|som}</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span>img</span><span>
and</span><span>
som</span><span> correspond to single image and Sommerfeld
integrals. By default, </span><span><span>som</span></span><span> is used, unless the substrate is perfectly conducting (then </span><span><span>img</span></span><span>). Adding a new option to calculate the reflection term is
straightforward for anyone who is familiar with C programming language.<a><span><span><span><span>[48]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
