        <h1>Interaction term</h1>

<p><span>A few
formulations for the direct interaction term are known </span><span>[2]</span><span>. Currently,
</span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> can use the simplest one (interaction of point dipoles), the FCD
(in other words, filtered Green’s tensor </span><span>[19]</span><span>),
quasistatic version of the FCD, the Integrated Green’s Tensor (IGT, </span><span>[14]</span><span>),
approximation of IGT (IGT<sub>SO</sub>). There are also a few prescriptions
under development: non-local (NLOC and NLOC<sub>av</sub>) and second order (SO).
The interaction of point dipoles is described by the Green’s tensor of the free
space:</span></p>

<p><span>where <b>r</b><i><sub>i</sub></i> is the radius-vector of the
dipole center, </span><b><span>R</span></b><span> = <b>r</b><i><sub>j</sub></i> &#8722; <b>r</b><i><sub>i</sub></i>,
<i>R</i> = |<b>R</b>|, and <i>R</i></span><i><span>&#770;</span></i><i><span>R</span><span>&#770;</span></i><span> is a tensor defined as <i>R</i></span><i><span>&#770;</span></i><i><span>R</span><span>&#770;<sub>µ&#957;</sub></span></i><span> = <i>R<sub>µ</sub>R<sub>&#957;</sub></i>. The filtered
Green’s tensor is defined </span><span>[19]</span><span> as</span></p>

<p><i><span>k</span></i><sub><span>F</span></sub><span> = <i>&#960;</i>/<i>d</i> – the wavenumber corresponding to the
grid, and <i>g</i><sub>F</sub> is the filtered
scalar Green’s function:</span></p>

<table>
 <tr>
  
  <td>
  <p><span>(</span><span><span>36</span></span><span>)</span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>To apply this formulation <i>k</i><sub>F</sub> must be larger than <i>k</i>, i.e. dpl &gt; 2.
Quasistatic FCD is obtained in the limit <i>kR</i> </span><span><span>®</span></span><span> 0, which leads to a simpler expression </span><span>[51]</span><span>:</span></p>

  <p><span>(</span><span><span>37</span></span><span>)</span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>Although it is just a special case of full
FCD, it is implemented in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> as a separate option for testing and research purposes. Since FCD
was originally designed for high refractive indices, we recommend using it especially
in this regime. However, it also works fine for moderate refractive index,
generally not worse than the standard approach of point dipoles </span><span>[23]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>The IGT directly accounts for the finiteness
of the cubical dipole, by integrating over its volume <i>V<sub>j</sub></i> </span><span>[14]</span><span>:</span></p>

 <tr>
  <td>
  <p><span>.</span></p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p><a><span>(</span></a><span><span><span>38</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>Implementation of the IGT in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> is based on the Fortran code kindly provided by IGT’s original
authors </span><span>[14]</span><span>. IGT<sub>SO</sub>
is based on approximate evaluation of Eq. </span><span>(<span>38</span>)</span><span>, up
to second order of <i>kd</i>, using tabulated integrals. Thus it is almost as
fast as Eq. </span><span>(<span>33</span>)</span><span> and
almost as accurate as IGT. Both IGT and IGT<sub>SO</sub> are known to perform
very good for small scatterers with large and almost real refractive indices.</span></p>

<p><span>The choice of the interaction term is performed
by the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-int &lt;type&gt; [&lt;arg1&gt;
[&lt;arg2&gt;]]</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span>&lt;type&gt;</span><span> is one of the </span><span>fcd</span><span>, </span><span>fcd_st</span><span>, </span><span><span>igt</span></span><span>, </span><span>igt_so</span><span>, </span><span><span>nloc</span></span><span>, </span><span><span>nloc_av</span></span><span>, </span><span>poi</span><span>, </span><span>so</span><span>. Two optional arguments are relevant only for </span><span><span>igt</span></span><span>. </span><span><span>&lt;arg1&gt;</span></span><span> is the maximum distance (in dipole sizes), for which integration is
performed. For larger distances simpler Eq. </span><span>(<span>33</span>)</span><span> is
used. Using value of this parameter from 1 to 3 is recommended – then extra
computational time for the IGT is rather small, while most of the accuracy gain
is achieved (compared to the default IGT without distance limit). </span><span><span>&lt;arg2&gt;</span></span><span> specifies the relative error of the integration (minus its decimal
logarithm). By default the same value as argument of </span><span><span>&#8209;eps</span></span><span> command line option (§</span><span>12.1</span><span>) is
used. For IGT<sub>SO</sub> and SO formulation tables of precalculated integrals
are used, they are automatically read from files in </span><span>tables/</span><span> (§</span><span>D.1</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>The default formulation for interaction term
is that of point dipoles (</span><span><span>poi</span></span><span>); however, it is expected to be inferior to </span><span><span>fcd</span></span><span> or </span><span><span>igt</span></span><span> in many cases. However, the latter have been studied in much less
details. Moreover, counterparts of those advanced formulations are still
lacking for the reflection term (§</span><span>10.3</span><span>), so
predicting accuracy in the surface mode (§</span><span>7</span><span>) is
even more problematic. Therefore, we recommend testing different formulations
for a particular class of scattering problems of interest. Moreover, adding a new
option to calculate the interaction term is straightforward for anyone who is
familiar with C programming language.<a><span><span><span><span>[47]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
