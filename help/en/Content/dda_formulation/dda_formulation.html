        <h1>DDA Formulation</h1>

<p><a><span><span>Since its introduction by
Purcell and Pennypacker </span></span></a><span><span><span>[3]</span></span></span><span><span><span> the DDA
has been constantly developed; therefore a number of different DDA formulations
exist </span></span></span><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span><span><span><span>. Here
we only provide a short summary, focusing on those that are implemented in </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>. All formulations are equivalent to the solution of the linear
system to determine unknown dipole polarizations <b>P</b><i><sub>i</sub></i></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>where is the incident
electric field (§</span></span></span><span><span><span>9.2</span></span></span><span><span><span>), is the dipole
polarizability (self-term), <b>H&#773;</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i>
is the total interaction term (Green’s tensor of the environment), and indices <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> enumerate the dipoles. In the free-space mode <b>H&#773;</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i> = <b>G&#773;</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i> (direct
interaction), while in the surface mode (§</span></span></span><span><span><span>7</span></span></span><span><span><span>) it
additionally contains reflection term <b>R&#773;</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i>
(<b>H&#773;</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i> = <b>G&#773;</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i>+<b> R&#773;</b><i><sub>ij</sub></i>). Moreover, we postulate </span></span></span><span><span><span>(but not ), i.e. the proper treatment of the corresponding self-action
singularity is traditionally included in the expression for </span><span>(§</span></span></span><span><span><span>10.1</span></span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span>. </span><span>The
(total) internal electric field <b>E</b><i><sub>i</sub></i> is the one present in a
homogenous particle modeled by an array of dipoles, also known as macroscopic
field </span></span></span><span><span><span>[44]</span></span></span><span><span><span>. It
should be distinguished from the exciting electric field that is a sum of and the field due to
all other dipoles (and substrate, if present), but excluding the field of the
dipole <i>i</i> itself. Both total and
exciting electric field can be determined once the polarizations are known:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>where <i>V</i><sub><span>d</span></sub> = <i>d</i><sup>3</sup> is the
volume of a dipole and </span></span></span><span><span><i><span>&#967;<sub>i</sub></span></i></span></span><span><span><span> = (<i>&#949;<sub>i</sub></i> &#8722; 1)/4<i>&#960;</i> is the susceptibility of the
medium at the location of the dipole <b>(</b><i>&#949;<sub>i</sub></i> – relative
permittivity<b>)</b>. In the following we
will also refer to <b>E</b> as internal
fields (those inside the particle) in contrast to near- and far-fields, which
are calculated from <b>E</b> or <b>P</b> together with other scattering
quantities. Below we discuss different formulations for </span><span>the polarizability prescription (§</span></span></span><span><span><span>10.1</span></span></span><span><span><span>), direct
interaction (§</span></span></span><span><span><span>10.2</span></span></span><span><span><span>) and
reflection terms (§</span></span></span><span><span><span>10.3</span></span></span><span><span><span>), and
formulae to calculate scattering quantities (§</span></span></span><span><span><span>10.4</span></span></span><span><span><span>). In
addition to the published ones, </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> contains options to use new theoretical improvements under
development. We do not discuss them here, since they are still in the early
research phase. However, you may try them at your own risk.</span></span></span></p>
