        <h1>Polarizability prescription</h1>

<p><span>A
number of expressions for the polarizability are known </span><span>[2]</span><span>. </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> implements the following: the Clausius–Mossotti (CM), the radiative
reaction correction (RR, </span><span>[45]</span><span>),
formulation by Lakhtakia (LAK, </span><span>[46]</span><span>),
digitized Green’s function (DGF, </span><span>[46]</span><span>),
approximate integration of Green’s tensor over the dipole (IGT<sub>SO</sub>, </span><span>[47]</span><span>), the
lattice dispersion relation (LDR, </span><span>[11]</span><span>),
corrected LDR (CLDR, </span><span>[48]</span><span>), and
the Filtered Coupled Dipoles (FCD). There are also a few prescriptions under
development: non-local (NLOC and NLOC<sub>av</sub>) and second order (SO). The
CM polarizability is the basic one, given by</span></p>

<p><span>Following formulations add second-order
corrections. LAK is based on replacing the cubical dipole by an equi-volume
sphere with radius <i>a</i><sub>d</sub> = <i>d</i>(3/4<i>&#960;</i>)<sup>1/3</sup>
and integrating Green’s tensor over it </span><span>[49]</span><span>:</span></p>

<p><span>Corrected LDR is independent on the
incident polarization but leads to the diagonal polarizability tensor instead
of scalar </span><span>[48]</span></p>

<p><span>where <i>&#948;<sub>µ&#957;</sub></i>
is the Kronecker symbol. The FCD polarizability is obtained from the value of
filtered Green’s tensor [Eq. </span><span>(<span>34</span>)</span><span>] for
zero argument, leading to </span><span>[23]</span></p>

<p><span>Naturally, Eq. </span><span>(<span>31</span>)</span><span> is
applicable only when <i>kd</i> &lt; <i>&#960;</i>, i.e. dpl &gt; 2. </span></p>

<p><span>All polarizability formulations, except CLDR
and SO, can be used together with anisotropic electric permittivity, given by a
<i>diagonal</i> tensor . Polarizability is then also a diagonal tensor, calculated
by the same formulae [Eqs. </span><span>(<span>22</span>)</span><span>–</span><span>(<span>31</span>)</span><span>] but
separately for each component:</span></p>

<p><span>The choice of the polarizability prescription
is performed by command line option</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span>&lt;type&gt;</span><span> is one
of the </span><span>cldr</span><span>, </span><span>cm</span><span>, </span><span>dgf</span><span>, </span><span>fcd</span><span>, </span><span>igt_so</span><span>, </span><span>lak</span><span>, </span><span>ldr</span><span>, </span><span><span>nloc</span></span><span>, </span><span><span>nloc_av</span></span><span>, </span><span>rrc</span><span>, </span><span>so</span><span>. </span><span>&lt;arg&gt;</span><span> is optional flag that can be only </span><span>avgpol</span><span> and only for
LDR specifying that the LDR polarizability should be averaged over incident
polarizations. Default is LDR without averaging. It is important to note that
this is not the best option for all cases. Our experience shows that LDR may
perform particularly badly (as compared to CM or RR) for very large refractive
indices, and FCD (together with its interaction term, §</span><span>10.2</span><span>)
becomes the best option </span><span>[23]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Finally, other DDA improvements are known,
which modify the polarizability (or permittivity) of the dipoles near the
boundary. These improvements include weighted discretization </span><span>[50]</span><span> and
spectral filtering of the permittivity that was proposed in combination with
the FCD </span><span>[19]</span><span>. These
ideas have not yet been implemented in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>.<a><span><span><span><span>[45]</span></span></span></span></a>
However, adding new options is straightforward for anyone who is familiar with
C programming language.<a><span><span><span><span>[46]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
