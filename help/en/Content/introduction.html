        <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><span>The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) is
a general method to calculate scattering and absorption of electromagnetic
waves by particles of arbitrary geometry. In this method the volume of the
scatterer is divided into small cubical subvolumes (“dipoles”). Dipole
interactions are approximated based on the integral equation for the electric
field </span><span>[2]</span><span>.
Initially the DDA (sometimes referred to as the “coupled dipole approximation”)
was proposed by Purcell and Pennypacker </span><span>[3]</span><span>
replacing the scatterer by a set of point dipoles (hence the name of the
technique). Although the final equations are essentially the same, derivations
based on the integral equations give more mathematical insight into the
approximation, while the model of point dipoles is physically clearer. For an
extensive review of the DDA, including both theoretical and computational
aspects, the reader is referred to </span><span>[2]</span><span>and references therein.</span></p>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> is a C implementation of the DDA. The development was conducted by Hoekstra
and coworkers </span><span>[4–7]</span><span> since 1990 at the University of Amsterdam. From the very beginning
the code was intended to run on a multiprocessor system or a multicore
processor (parallelizing a <i>single</i> DDA
simulation).<a><span><span><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></span></a> The code was significantly rewritten
and improved by Yurkin </span><span>[8]</span><span>,
also at the University of Amsterdam, and publicly released in 2006. Since then </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> is the open-source code developed by an international team.<a><span><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></span></a>
Originally coined “Amsterdam DDA”, the code name has been officially
abbreviated to reflect this change.</span></p>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> is intended to be a versatile tool, suitable for a wide variety of
applications ranging from interstellar dust and atmospheric aerosols to
biological cells and nanoparticles; its applicability is limited only by
available computer resources (§</span><span>4</span><span>). As
provided, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> should be usable for many applications without modification, but
the program is written in a modular form, so that modifications, if required,
should be fairly straightforward.<a><span><span><span><span><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p><span>This code is openly available to others in the
hope that it will prove a useful tool. We ask only that:</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>If you publish results obtained
using </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>, you should acknowledge the source of the code. A general reference
</span><span>[1]</span><span>
is recommended for that.<a><span><span><span><span>[4]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>If you discover any errors in
the code or documentation, please submit it to the </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> issue tracker.<a><span><span><span><span><span>[5]</span></span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

this will enable the developers to notify you of any bugs, corrections, or
improvements in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>. If you have a question about </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>, which you think is common,
please look into the FAQ<a><span><span><span><span><span>[8]</span></span></span></span></span></a> before searching for the answer in
this manual. If neither of these helps, direct your questions to </span><span><span>adda-discuss</span></span><span> Google group.<a><span><span><span><span><span>[9]</span></span></span></span></span></a> The archive of this group is
available,<a><span><span><span><span><span>[10]</span></span></span></span></span></a> so you may try to find an answer to
your question before posting it. However, this also means that you should <i>not</i> include (potentially) confidential
information in your message; in that case contact one of the developers
directly. We also advise users, interested in different aspects of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> usage, to join this group and to participate in discussions
initiated by other people.<a><span><span><span><span>[11]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
