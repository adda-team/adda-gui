        <h1>Surface Mode</h1>

<p><span>Apart from the default
free-space mode, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> is applicable to particles (finite systems of scatterers) located
above the plane surface parallel to the <i>xy</i>&#8209;plane
</span><span>[37]</span><span>. This
is enabled by command line option:</span></p>

<p><span>-surf &lt;h&gt; {&lt;mre&gt;
&lt;mim&gt;|inf}</span></p>

<p><span>where <i>h</i> is the distance from surface to the
particle center (in </span><span>&#956;</span><span>m). Following argument(s) specify the refractive index of the
substrate (below the surface), assuming that the vacuum is above the surface.
It is done either by two values (real and imaginary parts of the complex value)
or as effectively infinite </span><span><span>inf</span></span><span> which corresponds to perfectly reflective surface (§</span><span>7</span><span>). The
case of particle fully submerged into the <i>non-absorbing</i>
substrate can also be handled by rescaling all refractive indices (including
the vacuum above the substrate) by <i>m</i><sub>s</sub>
(§</span><span>4.2</span><span>) and
rotating the reference frame appropriately.</span></p>

<p><span>Details of the
implementation are described in other sections of the manual. There are,
however, a number of important caveats:</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Significant additional time for
initialization is required (§</span><span>5</span><span>, §</span><span>12.7</span><span>);</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>The surface mode is
incompatible with radiation forces (§</span><span>11.6</span><span>),
Gaussian incident beam (§</span><span>9.2</span><span>), WKB
initial field for the iterative solver (§</span><span>12.1</span><span>), and
rotation of particle (§</span><span>8</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>DDA accuracy, including
required discretization (§</span><span>4.1</span><span>), in the
surface mode is poorly studied and may strongly depend on the refractive index
and location of substrate.</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Definitions of common
light-scattering quantities, like Mueller scattering matrices or cross
sections, are somewhat ambiguous when beam is incoming from or scattered into
the substrate. See corresponding sections for specific definitions employed by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> (§</span><span>10.4</span><span>, §</span><span>11</span><span>). It
is even more ambiguous for absorbing substrate. Still, above-the-substrate
quantities are well-defined in all cases.</span></p>
