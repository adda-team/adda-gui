        <h1>Propagation direction</h1>

<p><span>The
direction of propagation of the incident radiation is specified by the command
line option</span></p>

<p><span>-prop &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>where arguments are <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> components of the propagation vector.
Normalization (to the unity vector <b>a</b>)
is performed automatically by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>. By default vector <b>e</b><i><sub>z</sub></i> = (0,0,1)
is used.</span></p>

<p><span>The option </span><span>&#8209;prop</span><span> is cumulative with rotation of the particle (ยง</span><span>8.1</span><span>)
because the latter is equivalent to the inverse rotation of incident wave and
scattering angles. If after all transformations the propagation vector is not
equal to the default (0,0,1), all the symmetries of the scatterer are cancelled
(ยง</span><span>6.7</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>The default (above) meaning of </span><span>&#8209;prop</span><span> option is used for directed beams, like plane or Gaussian beams. However,
it has a very different meaning for dipole incident field (determines dipole
orientation), and may also be not relevant for incident beams read from file (ยง</span><span>9.2</span><span>).
Still, in all cases it (the vector <b>a</b>)
determines the incident-wave reference frame (ยง</span><span>6.1</span><span>).</span></p>
