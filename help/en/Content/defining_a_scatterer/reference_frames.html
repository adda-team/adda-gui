        <h1>Reference frames</h1>

<p><span>Three different reference frames are used
by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>: laboratory, particle, and incident wave reference frames. The
laboratory reference frame is the default one, and all input parameters and
other reference frames are specified relative to it. </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> simulates light scattering in the particle reference frame, which
naturally corresponds to particle geometry and symmetries, to minimize the size
of the computational grid (§</span><span>6.2</span><span>),
especially for elongated or oblate particles. In this reference frame the
computational grid is built along the coordinate axes. The incident wave
reference frame is defined by setting the <i>z</i>&#8209;axis
along the propagation direction (more precisely, the argument of </span><span><span>&#8209;prop</span></span><span> option, §</span><span>9.1</span><span>). In
some cases it is used for definition of scattering plane and angles (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>The origins of all reference frames coincide
with the center of the computational grid (§</span><span>6.2</span><span>). By
default, both particle and incident wave reference frames coincide with the
laboratory frame. However, they can be made different by rotating the particle
(§</span><span>8</span><span>) or by
</span><span><span>&#8209;prop</span></span><span> option (§</span><span>9.1</span><span>)
respectively. If you are unsure about the dipole coordinates or the position of
the reference frame relative to the particle, try saving the incident beam to
the file (§</span><span>9</span><span>).
Then, the resulting file (§</span><span>C.9</span><span>) will
contain dipole coordinates in the particle reference frame.</span></p>
