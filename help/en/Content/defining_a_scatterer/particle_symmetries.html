        <h1>Particle symmetries</h1>

<p><span>Symmetries of a light-scattering problem
are used in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> to reduce simulation time. All the symmetries are defined for the
default incident beam (§</span><span>9</span><span>). If
the particle is symmetric with respect to reflection over the <i>xz</i>&#8209;plane (<i>yz</i>&#8209;plane), only half of the scattering <i>yz</i>&#8209;plane (<i>xz</i>&#8209;plane)
is considered (scattering angle from 0° to 180°, §</span><span>11.1</span><span>). If the
particle is symmetric with respect to rotation by 90° over the <i>z</i>&#8209;axis, the Mueller matrix in the <i>yz</i>&#8209;plane (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>) can
be calculated from the calculation of the internal fields for just one incident
polarization (<i>y</i>&#8209;polarization is
used). The second polarization is then equivalent to the first one but with
scattering in the <i>xz</i>&#8209;plane (in
negative direction of <i>x</i>&#8209;axis). Analogous
scheme is used for another scattering plane (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>). The
symmetries are automatically determined for all the predefined shapes (§</span><span>6.4</span><span>).
Some or all of them are automatically cancelled if not default beam type and/or
direction (§</span><span>9</span><span>),
anisotropic refractive index (§</span><span>6.3</span><span>), or
granule generator (§</span><span>6.5</span><span>) are
used.</span></p>

<p><span>Use of symmetry can be controlled by the command
line option:</span></p>

<p><span>-sym {auto|no|enf}</span></p>

<p><span>First option corresponds to the default
behavior described before, while </span><span>no</span><span> and </span><span>enf</span><span> specify to never use or enforce symmetry respectively. Use the
latter with caution, as it may lead to erroneous results. It may be useful if
the scattering problem is symmetric, but </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> do not recognize it
automatically, e.g. for particles that are read from file or when non-default
incident beam is used, which does not spoil the symmetry of the problem (e.g. plane
wave propagating along the <i>x</i>&#8209;axis
for a cubical scatterer). It is important to note that not the scatterer but
its dipole representation should be symmetric;<a><span><span><span><span>[38]</span></span></span></span></a>
otherwise the accuracy of the result will generally be slightly worse than that
when symmetry is not enforced. The final symmetries determined by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> are saved to log (§</span><span>C.4</span><span>),
where </span><span><span>X</span></span><span>, </span><span><span>Y</span></span><span>, </span><span><span>Z</span></span><span> denote symmetries along the corresponding axes (i.e. with respect
to reflection over the <i>xy</i>-, <i>xz</i>-, and <i>yz</i>&#8209;planes respectively) and </span><span><span>R</span></span><span>
denotes symmetry with respect to rotation by 90° over the <i>z</i>&#8209;axis. Alternatively, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> specifies that
symmetries are either cancelled or enforced by user.</span></p>

<p><span>Particle symmetries can also be used to
decrease the range of orientation/scattering angles for different
averagings/integrations. However, it is user’s responsibility to decide how a particular
symmetry can be employed. This is described in the descriptions of
corresponding input parameters files (§</span><span>B.2</span><span>, §</span><span>B.3</span><span>, §</span><span>B.4</span><span>).</span></p>
