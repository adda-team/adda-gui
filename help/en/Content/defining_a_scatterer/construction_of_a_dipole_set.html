        <h1>Construction of a dipole set</h1>

<p><span>After defining the computational grid (§</span><span>6.2</span><span>) each
dipole of the grid should be assigned a refractive index (a void dipole is
equivalent to a dipole with refractive index equal to 1). This can be done
automatically for a number of predefined shapes or in a very flexible way by
specifying scatterer geometry in a separate input file. For predefined shapes (§</span><span>6.4</span><span>) the
dipole is assigned to the scatterer if and only if its center falls inside the
shape, see </span><span>Fig. <span>2</span></span><span>(a)
for an example. When the scatterer consists of several domains, e.g. a coated
sphere, the same rule applies to each domain. By default, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> slightly corrects the dipole size (or equivalently dpl) to ensure
that the volume of the dipole representation of the particle is exactly correct
[</span><span>Fig. <span>2</span></span><span>(b)],
i.e. exactly corresponds to <i>x</i>. This
is believed to increase the accuracy of the DDA, especially for small
scatterers </span><span>[10]</span><span>.
However, it introduces a minor inconvenience that the size of the computational
grid is not exactly equal to the size of the particle. The volume correction
can be turned off by command line option</span></p>

<p><span>In this case </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> tries to match the size of the particle using specified <i>kD<sub>x</sub></i> or calculating it from
specified <i>x</i> (if shape permits).
Moreover, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> then determines the “real” value of <i>x</i> numerically from the volume of the dipole representation. Its
value is shown in </span><span><span>log</span></span><span> file (§</span><span>C.4</span><span>) and
is further used in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>, e.g. for normalization of cross sections (§</span><span>11.4</span><span>),
although it may slightly differ from specified or analytically derived <i>x</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>To read particle geometry from a file, specify
the file name as an argument to the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-shape read &lt;filename&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>This file specifies all the dipoles in the
simulation grid that belongs to the particle (possibly several domains with
different refractive indices). Supported formats include </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> text formats and </span><span><span>DDSCAT</span></span><span> 6 and 7 shape formats (see
§</span><span>B.5</span><span> for
details). Dimensions of the computational grid are then initialized
automatically. Packages </span><span><span>misc/pip</span></span><span> and </span><span><span>misc/hyperfun</span></span><span> allow one to transform a variety of common 3D shape formats to one
readable by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>. It is also possible to add support for new shape format directly
into </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>.<a><span><span><span><span>[28]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Sometimes it is useful to describe particle
geometry in a coarse way by larger dipoles (cubes), but then use smaller
dipoles for the simulation itself.<a><span><span><span><span>[29]</span></span></span></span></a>
</span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> enables this by the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-jagged &lt;arg&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>that specifies a multiplier <i>J</i>. Large cubes (<i>J</i>?<i>J</i>?<i>J</i> dipoles) are used [</span><span>Fig. <span>2</span></span><span>(c)]
for construction of the dipole set. Cube centers are tested for belonging to a
particle’s domain. All grid dimensions are multiplied by <i>J</i>. When particle geometry is read from file it is considered to be
a configuration of big cubes, each of them is further subdivided into <i>J</i><sup>3</sup> dipoles.</span></p>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> includes a granule generator, which can randomly fill any specified
domain with granules of a predefined size. It is described in details in §</span><span>6.5</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>The last parameter to completely specify a
scatterer is its refractive index. Refractive indices are given on the command
line</span></p>

<p><span>-m {&lt;m1Re&gt; &lt;m1Im&gt;
[…]|&lt;m1xxRe&gt; &lt;m1xxIm&gt; &lt;m1yyRe&gt; &lt;m1yyIm&gt; &lt;m1zzRe&gt;
&lt;m1zzIm&gt; […]}</span></p>

<p><span>Each pair of arguments specifies the real
and imaginary part<a><span><span><span><span>[30]</span></span></span></span></a>
of the refractive index of the corresponding domain (first pair corresponds to
domain number 1, etc.). Command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-anisotr</span></p>

<p><span>can be used to specify that a refractive
index is anisotropic. In that case three refractive indices correspond to one
domain. They are the diagonal elements of the refractive index tensor in the
particle reference frame (§</span><span>6.1</span><span>).
Currently </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> supports only diagonal refractive index tensors; moreover, the
refractive index must change discretely. Anisotropy cannot be used with either CLDR
polarizability (§</span><span>10.1</span><span>) or
SO formulations (§</span><span>10.1</span><span>, §</span><span>10.2</span><span>, §</span><span>10.4</span><span>),
since they are derived assuming isotropic refractive index, and cannot be
easily generalized. Use of anisotropic refractive index cancels the rotation
symmetry if its <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>&#8209;components differ. Limited
testing of this option was performed for Rayleigh anisotropic spheres.</span></p>

<p><span>The maximum number of different refractive
indices (particle domains) is defined at compilation time by the parameter </span><span>MAX_NMAT</span><span> in the file </span><span>const.h</span><span>. By default it is
set to 15. The number of the domain in the geometry file (§</span><span>B.5</span><span>)
exactly corresponds to the number of the refractive index. Numbering of domains
for the predefined shapes is described in §</span><span>6.4</span><span>. If
no refractive index is specified, it is set to 1.5, but this default option
works only for single-domain isotropic scatterers. Currently </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> produces an error if any of the given refractive index equals to 1.
It is planned to improve this behavior to accept such refractive index and
automatically make corresponding domain void. This can be used, for instance,
to generate spherical shell shape using standard option </span><span>–shape coated</span><span>. For now, one may set refractive index to the value very close to 1
for this purpose, e.g. equal to 1.00001.</span></p>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> saves the constructed dipole set to a file if the command line
option</span></p>

<p><span>-save_geom [&lt;filename&gt;]</span></p>

<p><span>is specified,
where </span><span>&lt;filename&gt;</span><span> is an optional argument. If it is not specified, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> names the output file </span><span>&lt;type&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;</span><span>. </span><span>&lt;type&gt;</span><span> is shape name – a first argument to the </span><span>&#8209;shape</span><span> command line option, see above and §</span><span>6.4</span><span>,
possibly with addition of </span><span>_gran</span><span> (§</span><span>6.5</span><span>). </span><span>&lt;ext&gt;</span><span> is determined by the format (</span><span><span>geom</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> and </span><span><span>dat</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>DDSCAT</span></span><span> formats), which itself is determined by the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-sg_format {text|text_ext|ddscat6|ddscat7}</span></p>

<p><span>First two are </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> default formats for single- and multi-domain particles
respectively. </span><span><span>DDSCAT</span></span><span> 6 and 7 format, which differ by a single line, are described in §</span><span>B.5</span><span>. </span><span>text</span><span> is
automatically changed to </span><span>text_ext</span><span> for multi-domain particles. Output formats are compatible with the
input ones (see §</span><span>C.11</span><span> for
details). The values of refractive indices are not saved (only domain numbers).
This option can be combined with </span><span>&#8209;prognosis</span><span>, then no
DDA simulation is performed but the geometry file is generated.</span></p>
