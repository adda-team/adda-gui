        <h1>General applicability</h1>

<p><span>The principal advantage of the DDA is that
it is completely flexible regarding the geometry of the scatterer, being
limited only by the need to use a dipole size <i>d</i> small compared to both any structural length in the scatterer and
the wavelength <i>&#955;</i>. A large number
of studies devoted to the accuracy of DDA results exist, e.g. </span><span>[8,10–19]</span><span>.
Most of them are reviewed in </span><span>[2]</span><span>;
here we only give a brief overview. The DDA is a “numerically exact” method,
i.e. it can reach any required accuracy given sufficient computational
resources. However, the required resources are not necessarily practically
acceptable.</span></p>

<p><span>The rule of thumb for particles in free space with
size comparable to the wavelength is: “10 dipoles per wavelength inside the
scatterer”, i.e. size of one dipole is </span></p>

<p><span>where <i>m</i>
is refractive index of the scatterer. That is the default for </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> (§</span><span>6.2</span><span>). The
expected accuracy of cross sections is then several percent (for moderate <i>m</i>, see below). With increasing <i>m</i> the number of dipoles that is used to
discretize the particle increases; moreover, the convergence of the iterative
solver (§</span><span>12.1</span><span>)
becomes slower. Additionally, the accuracy of the simulation with default
dipole size deteriorates, and smaller, hence more dipoles must be used to
improve it. Therefore, it is accepted that the refractive index should satisfy</span></p>

<p><span>Larger <i>m</i>
<i>can</i> also be simulated accurately. In
that case, however, the required computer resources rapidly increase with <i>m</i>. Fortunately, state-of-the-art DDA
formulations (§</span><span>10</span><span>) can alleviate
this problem and render larger refractive indices accessible to DDA simulations.
Note however that the application of the DDA in this large-<i>m</i> regime is investigated
much less thoroughly than for moderate refractive indices, and therefore
warrants further studies.</span></p>

<p><span>When considering
larger scatterers (volume-equivalent size parameter <i>x</i> &gt; 10) the rule of thumb still applies. However, it
does not describe well the dependence on <i>m</i>.
When employing the rule of thumb, errors do not significantly depend on <i>x</i>, but do significantly increase with <i>m</i> </span><span>[8]</span><span>.
However, simulation data for large scatterers is also limited; therefore, it is
hard to propose any simple method to set dipole size. The maximum reachable <i>x</i> and <i>m</i> are mostly determined by the available computer resources (§</span><span>5</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>The DDA is also applicable to particles
smaller than the wavelength, e.g. nanoparticles. In some respects, it is even
simpler than for larger particles, since many convergence problem for large <i>m</i> are not present for small scatterers.
However, in this regime there is an additional requirement for <i>d</i> – it should allow for an adequate
description of the shape of the particle. Although this requirement is relevant
for any scatterers, it is usually automatically satisfied for larger scatterers
by Eq. </span><span>(<span>1</span>)</span><span>. For
instance, for a sphere (or similar compact shape) it is recommended to use at
least 10 dipoles along the smallest dimension, no matter how small is the
particle. Smaller dipoles are required for irregularly shaped particles and/or
large refractive index. The accuracy of the DDA for gold nanoparticles was
studied in </span><span>[20]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>To conclude, it is hard to estimate <i>a priori</i> the accuracy of DDA simulation for
a particular particle shape, size, and refractive index, although the papers
cited above do give a hint. If one runs a single DDA simulation, there is no
better alternative than to use rule of thumb and hope that the accuracy will be
similar to that of the spheres, which can be found in one of the benchmark
papers (e.g. </span><span>[8,13,18]</span><span>).
However, if one plans a series of simulations for similar particles, especially
outside of the usual DDA application domain [Eq. </span><span>(<span>2</span>)</span><span>], it
is highly recommended to perform an accuracy study. For that one should choose
a single test particle and perform DDA simulations with different <i>d</i>, both smaller and larger than proposed
by the rule of thumb. The estimate of <i>d</i>
required for a particular accuracy can be obtained from a variation of results
with decreasing <i>d</i>. You may also make the estimation much more rigorous
by using an extrapolation technique, as proposed by Yurkin <i>et al.</i> </span><span>[21]</span><span>
and applied in </span><span>[20,22,23]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Finally, it is important to note that the
price paid for versatility of the DDA is its large computational costs, even
for “simple” scatterers. Thus, in certain cases other (more specialized)
methods will clearly be superior to the DDA. A review of relevant comparative
studies is given in </span><span>[2]</span><span>.
Additionally, it was recently shown that the DDA performs exceptionally well
for large index-matching particles (e.g. biological cells in a liquid medium).
In this regime the DDA is 10 to 100 times faster than a (general-purpose)
finite-difference time-domain method when required to reach the same accuracy </span><span>[22]</span><span>, and
is comparable in speed to the discrete sources method for red blood cells </span><span>[24]</span><span>,
where the latter method explicitly employs the axisymmetry of the problem.</span></p>
