        <h1>Extensions of the DDA</h1>

<p><span>In its original form the DDA is derived for
finite particles (or a set of several finite particles) in vacuum. However, it
is also applicable to finite particles embedded in a homogeneous non-absorbing dielectric
medium (refractive index <i>m</i><sub>0</sub>).
To account for the medium one should replace the particle (and environment) refractive
index <i>m</i> by the relative refractive
index <i>m</i>/<i>m</i><sub>0</sub>, and the wavelength in the vacuum <i>&#955;</i> by the wavelength in the medium <i>&#955;</i>/<i>m</i><sub>0</sub>. All the scattering quantities produced by DDA
simulations with such modified <i>m</i> and <i>&#955;</i> are then the correct ones for the
initial scattering problem. The only exception is the radiative force per each
dipole which should be additionally scaled in the presence of the medium (see §</span><span>11.6</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>While </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> can handle particles
near an infinite surface (§</span><span>7</span><span>), it
is not directly applicable to other infinite environments, such as multi-layer
substrates, waveguides, or particles crossing the infinite surface. However, a
number of approximate methods are still available:</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>One could consider the environment
only by its influence on the incident field; let us denote the modified
incident field as . This may be accurate enough if the particle is far from the
elements of the environment (e.g., boundary of the substrate) and/or the refractive
index of the environment is close to unity. Field need then to be given
to </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> through a file (§</span><span>9.2</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Another approach is to take a
large computational box around the particle, and explicitly discretize the environment
that falls into it </span><span>[25]</span><span>. This
is rigorous in the limit of infinite size of computational box, but requires
much larger computer resources than that for the initial problem. It also
requires one to specify the shape files for all different sizes of the
computational box.</span></p>

<p><span>The problem with the latter approach is the
diffraction of the plane wave on the edges of the computational domain. It can
be alleviated by using a Gaussian beam with a width smaller than the
computational domain but larger than all structural features of the problem (e.g.,
particles above or inside the multi-layered substrate) </span><span>[26]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>A combination of these two approaches was
proposed by D’Agostino<i> et al.</i> </span><span>[27]</span><span> to
decrease spurious boundary effects for infinite plane substrate, but can be
generalized to arbitrary environment. The total near- of far-field <b>E</b>(<b>r</b>)
is replaced by an adjusted field <b>E</b><sup>adj</sup>(<b>r</b>)</span></p>

<p><span>where <b>E</b><sup>env</sup>(<b>r</b>) is the result of a DDA simulation
for the truncated environment alone (without particles) with the free-space incident
field. It is expected that <b>E</b><sup>adj</sup>(<b>r</b>) will converge to the correct
solution with increasing computational domain faster than <b>E</b>(<b>r</b>).</span></p>

<p><span>Another useful
extension of the DDA is introduction of periodic boundary conditions </span><span>[28,29]</span><span>,
which is relevant to photonic crystals and similar applications. This requires
relatively simple modification of the algorithm and it was recently implemented
in the </span><span><span>DDSCAT</span></span><span> 7 </span><span>[30]</span><span>.
However, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> does <i>not</i> yet support this
feature.</span></p>
