        <h1>System Requirements</h1>

<p><span>Computational requirements of DDA primarily
depend on the size of the computational grid, which in turn depends on the size
parameter <i>x</i> and refractive index <i>m</i> of the scatterer (§</span><span>6.2</span><span>). This
section addresses requirements of standard (FFT) mode of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>, while sparse mode is discussed separately (§</span><span>12.3</span><span>). The
memory requirements of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> depend both on the total number of dipoles in a computational box (<i>N</i>) and the number of real (non-void)
dipoles (<i>N</i><sub>real</sub>); it also
depends on the number of dipoles along the <i>x</i>&#8209;axis
(<i>n<sub>x</sub></i>) and number of
processors or cores used (<i>n</i><sub>p</sub>).
The total memory requirement <i>M</i><sub>tot</sub> (for all processors) in the
free-space mode is approximately</span></p>

<p><span>where additional memory proportional to <i>N</i> is required only in parallel mode (see
§</span><span>12.2</span><span> for
details). Coefficient before <i>N</i><sub>real</sub>
depends on the chosen iterative solver, as 31 + 48(<i>n</i><sub>vec</sub> + 1), where <i>n</i><sub>vec</sub> is the number of vectors
used by the solver (§</span><span>12.1</span><span>, </span><span>Table 3</span><span>). In the
surface mode (§</span><span>7</span><span>) the
following additional memory is required</span></p>

<p><span>which is usually insignificant. The memory
requirements of each processor depends on the partition of the computational
grid over the processors that is generally not uniform (see §</span><span>6.6</span><span>).
Total memory used by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> and maximum per one processor are shown in </span><span>log</span><span> (see §</span><span>C.4</span><span>). It
is important to note that <i>double</i>
precision is used everywhere in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>. This requires more
memory as compared to single precision, but it helps when convergence of the
iterative solver is very slow and machine precision becomes relevant, as is the
case for large simulations, or when very accurate results are desired, as in </span><span>[21]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>There is a maximum number of processors, which
</span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> can effectively employ (§</span><span>6.6</span><span>),
equal to <i>n<sub>z</sub></i> if the latter
is a “round” number (§</span><span>12.2</span><span>).
This determines the largest problem size solvable on a given supercomputer with
very large number of processors but with a limited amount of memory per
processor <i>M</i><sub>pp</sub>. For a given problem, setting <i>n</i><sub>p</sub> = <i>n<sub>z</sub></i> leads to the following maximum
memory requirements per processor (in the free-space mode):<a><span><span><span><span>[22]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p><span>where <i>n</i><sub>slice</sub> &#8804; <i>n<sub>x</sub>n<sub>y</sub></i> is the
maximum number of real dipoles in a slice parallel to the <i>yz</i>&#8209;plane.</span></p>

<p><span>To have a quick estimate of maximum achievable
discretization on a given hardware, one may consider a cube and less-memory-consuming
iterative solvers. Then, Eqs. </span><span>(<span>4</span>)</span><span> and </span><span>(<span>6</span>)</span><span> lead
to maximum <i>n<sub>x</sub></i> equal to 113[<i>M</i><sub>tot</sub>(GB)]<sup>1/3</sup>
and 1067[<i>M</i><sub>pp</sub>(GB)]<sup>1/2</sup> for single-core PC and very
large cluster respectively.</span></p>

<p><span>In OpenCL mode the memory proportional to <i>N</i>
in Eq. </span><span>(<span>4</span>)</span><span> is
moved to the GPU thus reducing the used amount of main (CPU) memory. In this
case additional 8<i>N</i><sub>real</sub>
bytes of CPU memory is required for CGNR and Bi-CGStab iterative solvers.
Moreover, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> may additionally allocate up to 768<i>N</i>&#8729;min(1,16/<i>n<sub>x</sub></i>)
bytes (double that in the surface mode) on the GPU, if available, to improve
simulation speed (when </span><span><span>–opt
speed</span></span><span> is enabled, see below).</span></p>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> may optimize itself during runtime for either maximum speed or minimum
memory usage. It is controlled by a command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-opt {speed|mem}</span></p>

<p><span>By default, speed optimization is used. A
command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-prognosis</span></p>

<p><span>can be used to estimate the memory
requirements without actually performing the allocation of memory and
simulation.<a><span><span><span><span>[23]</span></span></span></span></a> It
also implies </span><span>&#8209;test</span><span> option (§</span><span>C.3</span><span>). By
default, this estimate is based on the upper limit of memory that ADDA can use
(especially, for OpenCL memory). To get the minimum required memory combine </span><span><span>–prognosis</span></span><span> with </span><span><span>–opt
mem</span></span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Simulation time (see §</span><span>12</span><span> for
details) consists of two major parts: solution of the linear system of
equations and calculation of the scattered fields. The first one depends on the
number of iterations to reach convergence, which mainly depends on the size
parameter, shape and refractive index of the scatterer, and time of one
iteration, which depends only on <i>N</i> as
</span><span>&#119978;</span><span>(<i>N</i>ln<i>N</i>) (see §</span><span>12.2</span><span>). Execution
time for calculation of scattered fields is proportional to <i>N</i><sub>real</sub>, and is usually relatively
small if scattering is only calculated in one plane. However, it may be
significant when a large grid of scattering angles is used (§</span><span>11.2</span><span>, §</span><span>11.4</span><span>). In the
surface mode (§</span><span>7</span><span>) significant
time is additionally required for initialization (building up the interaction
matrix, §</span><span>12.7</span><span>). Employing
multiple processors brings the simulation time down almost proportional to the
number of processors (see §</span><span>12.4</span><span>). To
facilitate very long simulations checkpoints can be used to break a single simulation
into smaller parts (§</span><span>12.5</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>For example, on a desktop computer
(P4-3.2 GHz, 2 Gb RAM) it was possible to simulate light scattering
by spheres<a><span><span><span><span>[24]</span></span></span></span></a> up
to <i>x</i> = 35 and 20 for <i>m</i> = 1.313 and 2.0 respectively
(simulation times are 20 and 148 hours respectively). The capabilities of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> 0.76 for simulation of light scattering by spheres using 64 3.4 GHz
cores were reported in </span><span>[8]</span><span>.
Here we present only Fig. </span><span><span>1</span></span><span>,
showing the maximum reachable <i>x</i>
versus <i>m</i> and simulation time versus <i>x</i> and <i>m</i>. In particular, light scattering by a homogenous sphere with <i>x</i> = 160 and <i>m</i> = 1.05 was simulated in only
1.5 hours, although the runtime steeply increased with refractive index.
Examples of more recent and even larger simulations are gathered on a special
wiki page.<a><span><span><span><span>[25]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
