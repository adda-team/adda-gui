        <h1>Precise timing</h1>

<p><span>This feature of </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> is used to perform the thorough timing of the most computationally
intensive parts: initialization of interaction matrix and FFT (especially </span><span><span>FFTW3</span></span><span>, §</span><span>12.2</span><span>) and matrix–vector
product. It gives the detailed information both on FFT and algebraic parts,
which can be used for deep optimization or performance studies. However, this
regime is incompatible with the normal </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> execution – it
terminates after the first matrix–vector product. Only the </span><span>stdout</span><span> (§</span><span>C.2</span><span>) and </span><span><span>log</span></span><span> (§</span><span>C.4</span><span>) are
produced. Precision of the precise timing routines are of order µs, however they
measure wall-time<a><span><span><span><span>[87]</span></span></span></span></a>
and are operating-system-dependent (see §</span><span>13.1</span><span>). To
enable precise timing recompile </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> with option </span><span><span>PRECISE_TIMING</span></span><span>.</span><sup><span>12</span></sup></p>
