<p><span><span>Additional
files contributed by users will be located in the directory </span></span><span><span>misc/</span><span>. These files should be
considered to be supported (to some extent) by their respective authors. They
should be accompanied by enough information to explain their use. A brief
description of the available tools is given together with description of </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> package.</span></span><span><sup><span>13</span></sup></span><span><span> Moreover, being a command
line tool </span></span><span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> easily lends itself to scripting and automatization. In particular,
there is a wrapper in language R with several usage examples</span></span><a><span><span><span><span><span><span>[88]</span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span> â€“ it can be easily
generalized to other scripting languages and applications.</span></span></p>
