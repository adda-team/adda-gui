        <h1>OpenCL (GPU) mode</h1>

<p><span>This mode is very similar to the sequential
mode, except </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> executable is named </span><span><span>adda_ocl</span></span><span> and part of the
calculations is carried on the GPU </span><span>[9]</span><span>. Therefore
a GPU, supporting double precision calculations, is required as well as recent
drivers for it. Currently, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> can use only a single GPU, and will choose the first (default) one,
if several GPUs are available. To use another GPU, specify its index (starting
from zero) through the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-gpu &lt;index&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>Therefore, several instances of </span><span><span>adda_ocl</span></span><span> can be run in parallel, each using one CPU core and one GPU.</span></p>

<p><span>More details about the OpenCL implementation,
including existing limitations are described in the corresponding wiki page.<a><span><span><span><span>[21]</span></span></span></span></a>
While the developers do their best to ensure reliability of OpenCL mode, it is
a good idea to perform selected tests of this mode against the sequential mode
on your specific hardware before performing a large set of simulations.</span></p>
