        <h1>Near-field</h1>

<p><span>Near-field is the electric field near the
particle, i.e. neither in the particle itself nor far enough to be considered a
scattered field. Currently, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> cannot calculate the near-field in a completely convenient manner. However,
Fabio Della Sala and Stefania D'Agostino </span><span>[27]</span><span> have
contributed a package </span><span><span>near_field</span></span><span>, which adds this functionality using the dipole polarizations calculated
by </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>. This package is distributed in the </span><span><span>misc/</span></span><span> folder, and is accompanied by all necessary instructions.</span></p>

<p><span>While the above
option is recommended one, there exist another workaround that may be
preferential in some special cases. One may include all the points, where
near-field need to be calculated, in the particle geometry, but set their
refractive index to a value very close to 1 (e.g. 1.00001). Then the scattering
problem is identical to the initial one. Saving the internal fields (§</span><span>11.7</span><span>) will
directly produce the required near-field together with the field inside the
particle, even in the surface mode </span><span>[37]</span><span>. The
drawback of this workaround is increase of computational time, which depends on
the size of the box containing the extended particle geometry. Moreover, a user
is required to specify a shape file, except for the simplest cases. For
instance, predefined shapes “</span><span>coated</span><span>” or “</span><span>spherebox</span><span>” (§</span><span>6.4</span><span>) can
be used to calculate near-field in a sphere or cube around the homogenous
sphere, respectively. However, this method can be much faster when full 3D
picture of the near field is required, because it implicitly uses
FFT-acceleration of the simulations. This idea was further developed for even
more efficient calculation of the near-field </span><span>[69]</span><span>, but
this approach has not been yet implemented in </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span>.</span></p>
