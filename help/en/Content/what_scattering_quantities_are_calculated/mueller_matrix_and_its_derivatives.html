        <h1>Mueller matrix and its derivatives</h1>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> calculates the complete Mueller scattering matrix </span><span>[53]</span><span>
for a set of scattering angles. The Mueller matrix is 4?4 real matrix, which relates
the Stokes vector of scattered and incoming waves (the latter is different from
incident field in the surface mode, §</span><span>9.2</span><span>):</span></p>

<p><span>where the exponent is
non-trivial only for scattering into the absorbing substrate. The definitions
of the Stokes vector through the electric fields can be found in textbooks </span><span>[53,58]</span><span>. In
particular, this definition contains the refractive index of the medium <i>m</i> as factor </span><span>&#8476;</span><span>(<i>m</i>) </span><span>[58]</span><span>. The
Mueller matrix can be obtained from the amplitude matrix (§</span><span>11.3</span><span>) using
the well-known formulae </span><span>[53]</span><span>.
However, in the surface mode (§</span><span>7</span><span>) the result
of this formulae need to additionally multiplied by </span><span>&#8476;</span><span>(<i>m</i><sub>sca</sub>)/</span><span>&#8476;</span><span>(<i>m</i><sub>in</sub>) due to
the corresponding factors discussed above – see, e.g., Eq. </span><span>(<span>56</span>)</span><span> below.
In other words, the Mueller matrix relates the irradiances of the waves, not
just squared norms of the electric fields.</span></p>

<p><span>Note also that
the Mueller matrix is dimensionless and not normalized.<a><span><span><span><span>[53]</span></span></span></span></a>
Moreover, it is defined with respect to the scattering reference frame opposed
to the laboratory reference frame used in definition of the Stokes phase matrix
</span><span>[58]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>By default scattering in a single scattering
plane (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>) is
calculated and the result is saved in file </span><span><span>mueller</span></span><span> (§</span><span>C.5</span><span>). To calculate
the Mueller matrix in one scattering plane </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> simulates two incident
polarizations, except when the particle is symmetric with respect to the
rotation by 90° over the propagation vector of incident radiation (§</span><span>6.7</span><span>). In
the latter case one incident polarization and two scattering planes are used
instead.</span></p>

<p><span>More advanced options are available to
calculate scattering at any set of angles. If any of the two command line
options</span></p>

<p><span>-store_scat_grid</span></p>

<p><span>-phi_integr &lt;arg&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>is specified, the Mueller matrix is
calculated for a set of angles, specified, by default, in file </span><span>scat_params.dat</span><span> (§</span><span>B.4</span><span>). The
first flag indicates that values of the Mueller matrix for all calculated
angles should be saved to file </span><span>mueller_scatgrid</span><span> (§</span><span>C.5</span><span>),
while the second flag turns on the integration of Mueller matrix over <i>&#966;</i><span> with different multipliers</span>. The latter is defined by </span><span>&lt;arg&gt;</span><span>, an integer from 1 to 31, each bit of which, from lowest to
highest, corresponds to multipliers 1, cos(2<i>&#966;</i>),
sin(2<i>&#966;</i>), cos(4<i>&#966;</i>), and sin(4<i>&#966;</i>) respectively.<a><span><span><span><span>[54]</span></span></span></span></a>
Integration results are saved to files </span><span>mueller_integr</span><span>, </span><span>mueller_integr_c2</span><span>, </span><span>mueller_integr_s2</span><span>, </span><span>mueller_integr_c4</span><span>, and </span><span>mueller_integr_s4</span><span> respectively (§</span><span>C.5</span><span>). It
is important to note that the results of the integration are divided by the
width of the <i>&#966;</i> interval (2<i>&#960;</i> by default), i.e. actually
averaging over <i>&#966;</i> takes place. If
both above-mentioned command line options are specified, both complete-grid and
integrated results are saved to hard disk.</span></p>

<p><span>The format of the input file is very flexible
(see §</span><span>B.4</span><span> for
details) allowing one to use either values uniformly spaced in some interval or
any set of values, which is explicitly specified, for <i>&#952;</i> and <i>&#966;</i>
independently. Even an arbitrary set of (<i>&#952;</i>,<i>&#966;</i>) pairs can be used. However, if
integration over <i>&#966;</i> is used, a
set of <i>&#966;</i> values must comply with
the Romberg integration (§</span><span>12.6</span><span>). A different
file describing a set of angles can be used if specified as an argument to the
command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-scat_grid_inp &lt;filename&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>When a grid of scattering angles is calculated
(either for saving or integrating over <i>&#966;</i>)
the scattering in a single scattering plane is by default <i>not</i> calculated. However, </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> may be forced to calculate
it by specifying command line option </span><span><span>&#8209;yz</span></span><span> or </span><span><span>&#8209;scat_plane</span></span><span> (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>The Mueller matrix contains the complete intensity-based
information about angle-resolved scattering for any incident polarization, but
other quantities are also commonly used, e.g. differential scattering cross
section. Depending on the incident polarization it can be calculated as [cf.
Eq. </span><span>(<span>47</span>)</span><span>]:</span></p>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p><span>,</span></p>

  </td>
 </tr>

<p><span>where plus and minus correspond to incident
polarization along the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>&#8209;axis respectively, and <i>&#966;</i> is the azimuthal angle of the
scattering direction (relative to the <i>x</i>&#8209;axis),
and |…| is used since <i>k</i><sub>sca</sub>
is generally complex. “unpol” denotes unpolarized incident light. Eq. </span><span>(<span>55</span>)</span><span> is
derived from formulae given in </span><span>[53]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>In other applications, the following
scattering intensities are of interest:</span></p>

<table>
 <tr>
  
  <td>
  <p><a><span>(</span></a><span><span><span>56</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>where ||&#8214; and </span><span><span>^</span></span><span> denote respectively parallel and perpendicular components (relative
to the scattering frame) of the incident and scattered fields. <i>S</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>S</i><sub>4</sub>
are elements of the amplitude matrix (§</span><span>11.3</span><span>). Corresponding
differential cross sections can be obtained from scattering intensities through
division by [cf. Eq. </span><span>(<span>55</span>)</span><span>]. We
generalized Eq. </span><span>(<span>56</span>)</span><span> and
others below to the surface mode, but we are not aware of such non-free-space
uses.</span></p>

<p><span>In applications involving preferential
direction it is customary to denote two components of the incident and
scattered fields as vertical (v) and horizontal (h). The correspondence between
those and ||, </span><span><span>^</span></span><span> depends on a particular application.
For instance, if all considered scattering planes contain the <i>z</i>&#8209;axis,
|| and </span><span><span>^</span></span><span> correspond to v and h respectively </span><span>[60]</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Another related quantity is (radar)
backscattering cross section. The name itself is somewhat misleading, since it
denotes not the integral quantity (as in §</span><span>11.4</span><span>) but
the differential scattering cross section at exact backscattering direction
multiplied by 4<i>&#960;</i> </span><span>[53]</span><span>.
It can be decomposed into different components, as in Eq. </span><span>(<span>56</span>)</span><span>, , where <i>&#945;</i> and <i>&#946;</i> can be replaced by
||, </span><span><span>^</span></span><span>, v, h, <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> (see,
e.g., </span><span>[61]</span><span>).
Moreover, the expressions can be simplified using the symmetry fact <i>S</i><sub>12</sub> = <i>S</i><sub>21</sub>
for <i>&#952;</i> = 180° </span><span>[62]</span><span>.
Therefore, one can obtain the following cross section using the values in file </span><span><span>mueller</span></span><span> for <i>&#952;</i> = 180°, usually in the last line:</span></p>

  <p><span>,</span></p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p><span>(</span><span><span>57</span></span><span>)</span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><a><span>where the
alternating signs before <i>S</i><sub>12</sub>
are for <i>yz</i> (<i>&#966;</i> = 90°) and <i>xz</i>
(<i>&#966;</i> = 0°) scattering
planes respectively. Linear depolarization ratio (at backscattering) is defined
through these cross-sections </span></a><span><span>[61]</span></span><span><span>, while circular
polarization ratio <i>&#956;</i><sub>c</sub>
can be defined as </span></span><span><span>[63]</span></span><span><span> (for any <i>&#966;</i>):</span></span></p>
