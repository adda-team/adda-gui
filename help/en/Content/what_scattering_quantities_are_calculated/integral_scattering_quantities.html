        <h1>Integral scattering quantities</h1>

<p><span>All scattering quantities described in this
section are saved to several files (§</span><span>C.7</span><span>),
corresponding to each of two incident polarizations (</span><span>CrossSec&#8209;X</span><span> and </span><span>CrossSec&#8209;Y</span><span>) and to
orientation-averaged results (</span><span>CrossSec</span><span>). For the latter
the result is calculated for unpolarized incident light. However, it is equal
to that for any incident polarization, if the full range of Euler angle <i>&#945;</i> is used for averaging (§</span><span>8.2</span><span>). </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> always calculates <i>C</i><sub>ext</sub>
and <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub> (together with
corresponding efficiencies <i>Q</i><sub>ext</sub>,
<i>Q</i><sub>abs</sub>).<a><span><span><span><span>[57]</span></span></span></span></a>
Optionally, it can calculate scattering cross section <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> (and efficiency <i>Q</i><sub>sca</sub>)
and normalized and non-normalized asymmetry vectors – <b>g</b> and <b>g</b><i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> respectively. <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> and <b>g</b> are defined by Eqs. </span><span>(<span>47</span>)</span><span> and </span><span>(<span>48</span>)</span><span>
respectively, the <i>z</i>&#8209;component
of <b>g</b> is the usual asymmetry
parameter &lt;cos<i>&#952;</i>&gt;. Values
of cross sections are in units of µm<sup>2</sup>. All the efficiencies are
calculated by dividing the corresponding cross section over the area of the geometrical
cross section of the sphere with volume equal to that of dipole representation
of the particle, .<a><span><span><span><span>[58]</span></span></span></span></a>
Optional calculation of <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub>,
<b>g</b><i>C</i><sub>sca</sub>
and <b>g</b> can be enabled, respectively, by
command line options</span></p>

<p><span>-Csca</span></p>

<p><span>-vec</span></p>

<p><span>-asym</span></p>

<p><span>If <b>g</b>
is calculated <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> and <b>g</b><i>C</i><sub>sca</sub>
are also calculated automatically.<a><span><span><span><span>[59]</span></span></span></span></a>
The calculation of <b>g</b> and <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> is performed by
integration over the whole solid angle, using a grid of scattering angles. The
grid is specified by default in file </span><span>alldir_params.dat</span><span>
(see §</span><span>B.3</span><span> for
format) in a form suitable for the Romberg integration (§</span><span>12.6</span><span>).
Integration points for <i>&#952;</i> are
spaced uniformly in values of cos<i>&#952;</i>.
Different grid file can be specified through the command line option</span></p>

<p><span>-alldir_inp &lt;filename&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>In most cases <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> can be accurately
calculated as <i>C</i><sub>ext</sub> &#8722; <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub>, without using </span><span>&#8209;Csca</span><span>
option. As discussed in §</span><span>10.4</span><span>
accuracy of this method can be improved when <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> <span>&lt;</span>&lt; <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub> by using smaller <i>&#949;</i> (§</span><span>12.1</span><span>).
Whether this is more computationally effective than using </span><span>&#8209;Csca</span><span> or
not depends on the particular problem. For instance, <i>C</i><sub>ext</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub>
may coincide in (almost) all digits saved to file for particles much smaller
than the wavelength, leaving integration of scattered fields over the solid
angle as the only viable option. However, in this case the integration can be
done analytically (in the free-space mode), using formulae for the Rayleigh
regime. For a general non-symmetric particle formulae are cumbersome. However,
if total particle polarizability is a diagonal tensor in the laboratory
reference frame (e.g. general ellipsoid with axes along coordinate axes), then starting
from chapter 5.7 of </span><span>[53]</span><span>
one can derive:</span></p>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p><span>,</span></p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p><a><span>(</span></a><span><span><span>60</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p><span>where plus and minus
correspond to incident polarization along the <i>y</i>- and <i>x</i>&#8209;axis
respectively. Mueller matrix elements are considered at the forward direction
in the <i>yz</i>&#8209;plane (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>),
i.e. they can be found in the second line of the </span><span>mueller</span><span> file (§</span><span>11.2</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>When absorbing substrate is present (§</span><span>7</span><span>) the default
definition of <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> is
unphysical (§</span><span>10.4</span><span>). A
more adequate approach may be to integrate the scattered field only in the
upper hemisphere, which can be done by changing the range of <i>&#952;</i> to [0°,90°] in </span><span>alldir_params.dat</span><span> (§</span><span>B.3</span><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>Currently </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> provides no built-in
functionality for automatically scanning over a wavelength spectrum. However, a
simple workaround is to execute </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> for each wavelength
independently, using a script, and then collect the output data.<a><span><span><span><span>[60]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
