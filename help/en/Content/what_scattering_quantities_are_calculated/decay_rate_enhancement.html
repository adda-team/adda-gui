        <h1>Decay rate enhancement</h1>

<p><span>These quantities are calculated if and only
if the point-dipole incident field is used (§</span><span>9.2</span><span>). A
dipole with polarization <b>p</b><sub>0</sub>
at position <b>r</b><sub>0</sub> has a
certain decay rate in free-space, which is enhanced in the presence of
nanoparticle. The emitted energy is, in general, partly absorbed by the
particle (nonradiative part) and partly scattered to the infinity (radiative
part). The relevant formulae are given in </span><span>[65,66]</span><span>. Here
we present them in terms of effective cross sections (proportional to decay
rates) to reuse quantities described in §</span><span>11.4</span><span>.
Free-space decay cross section <i>C</i><sub>0</sub>
is given as</span></p>

<p><span>In the presence of the nanoparticle, the
total decay cross section <i>C</i><sub>tot</sub>
is also given by Eq. </span><span>(<span>61</span>)</span><span> but
with the modified Green’s tensor (accounting for particle):</span></p>

<p><span>has been used. <i>C</i><sub>enh</sub> corresponds to decay rate enhancement due to
particle and its simplified expression (assuming real <b>p</b><sub>0</sub>) is very similar (but not equal) to <i>C</i><sub>ext</sub> in Eq. </span><span>(<span>49</span>)</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>The part absorbed by the particle
(nonradiative, NR) is given by <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub>
(§</span><span>11.4</span><span>),
while radiative part <i>C</i><sub>rad</sub> = </span><i><span>&#1057;</span></i><sub><span>tot</span></sub><span> – <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub>, which is not equal to <i>C</i><sub>sca</sub> since incident dipole field interferes with the
scattered field. In other words, <i>C</i><sub>rad</sub>
is the scattering cross section of the whole set of dipoles, including both exciting
one and those from discretization of the particle. The enhancements of decay
rates are obtained by normalizing corresponding cross sections to <i>C</i><sub>0</sub>:</span></p>

<p><span>These three
enhancement factors are calculated and saved into file</span><span> CrossSec</span><span> (§</span><span>C.7</span><span>).
Note also that these factors are independent of the particular magnitude (or
units) of <b>p</b><sub>0</sub> used for
simulation.</span></p>

<p><span>In the surface mode (§</span><span>7</span><span>) the
decay rate is changed by the surface itself even when no particle is present.
Corresponding cross section <i>C</i><sub>surf</sub>
is obtained by replacing <b>G&#773;</b> by <b>G&#773;</b> + <b>R&#773;</b> (§</span><span>10.3</span><span>) in
Eq. </span><span>(<span>61</span>)</span><span>. </span><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> still calculates the enhancement factors using Eq. </span><span>(<span>65</span>)</span><span>, i.e.
normalizing to <i>C</i><sub>0</sub>, but
also saves <i>C</i><sub>surf</sub>/<i>C</i><sub>0</sub> into file</span><span> CrossSec</span><span> (§</span><span>C.7</span><span>), so
ratios with respect to <i>C</i><sub>surf</sub>
can be easily obtained manually. The important limitation exists for absorbing
substrate, since <i>C</i><sub>abs</sub> does
not include the absorption in the substrate. Then the total enhancement factor
is correct, but its division into radiative and not radiative parts is not. The
possible (complicated) workaround is to integrate the total far-field (sum of
exciting and scattered fields) over the upper hemisphere.<a><span><span><span><span>[61]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
