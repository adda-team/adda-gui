        <h1>Amplitude matrix</h1>

<p><span>An alternative
approach to characterize the scattering process is by 2?2 dimensionless complex
matrix, the amplitude scattering matrix, which </span><span>relates
scattered and incoming electric fields (the latter is different from incident
field in the surface mode, §</span><span>9.2</span><span>):</span></p>

<p><span>where </span><span><span>^</span></span><span> and || denote perpendicular and parallel components of the field,
respectively, with respect to the scattering plane (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>). The
definition for the free space corresponds to that in </span><span>[53]</span><span>,<a><span><span><span><span>[55]</span></span></span></span></a>
while </span><span>the generalization to the surface mode is in line
with that used previously for 2D case </span><span>[64]</span><span>.</span><span> Thus, the elements of the amplitude
scattering matrix are closely related to <b>F</b>(<b>n</b>) – cf. Eq. </span><span>(<span>42</span>)</span><span>. Compared to the intensity-based Mueller
matrix the amplitude matrix contains also the phase of the field, but it can be
measured only by limited number of experimental set-ups, mainly in microwave
frequency domain.</span></p>

<p><span><span>ADDA</span></span><span> can calculate the amplitude matrix when enabled by the command line
option</span></p>

<p><span>-scat_matr {muel|ampl|both|none}</span></p>

<p><span>which allows one to specify whether the
Mueller matrix (</span><span><span>muel</span></span><span>, the default choice), the amplitude matrix (</span><span><span>ampl</span></span><span>), </span><span><span>both</span></span><span>, or </span><span><span>none</span></span><span> should be calculated and saved to file.</span></p>

<p><span>The set of angles to calculate the amplitude
matrix are determined the same way as for the Mueller matrix (§</span><span>11.2</span><span>). In
particular, by default a uniform grid in the scattering plane (§</span><span>11.1</span><span>) is
used and the result is saved into file </span><span><span>ampl</span></span><span> (§</span><span>C.6</span><span>). When
</span><span><span>&#8209;store_scat_grid</span></span><span> is used, the amplitude matrix for a grid of scattering angles is
saved to file </span><span><span>ampl_scatgrid</span></span><span> (§</span><span>C.6</span><span>). However,
there is one important difference – no averaging of the amplitude matrix is
performed neither over orientation (</span><span><span>–orient avg</span></span><span>) nor over the
azimuthal scattering angle (</span><span><span>–phi_integr</span></span><span>).<a><span><span><span><span>[56]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
