<h1>Online Help</h1>

<p>Typefacer has the following options for using online help: 

<ul>
  <li>Embedded help, in which help is displayed in the application interface. As you move from
    screen to screen, the online help refreshes to display help for the current screen. You
    can show or hide embedded help using the <strong>Help</strong> menu.</li>
  <li>Field-level help, in which you can request help for a specific control on the screen.
    When you click the <img src="../Images/help.gif" width="15" height="16"
    alt="help.gif (879 bytes)"> button and then click a control, Typefacer displays help for
    that specific control.</li>
  <li>Standard help, in which you can display the online help and use a table of contents,
    index, or word search index to find topics. You can access standard help from the <strong>Help</strong>
    menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, Typefacer opens with embedded help displayed.</p>
